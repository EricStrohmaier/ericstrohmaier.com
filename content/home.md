# Welcome

**As a kid, I built cities out of LEGO - not because I followed the instructions, but because I ignored them.**

**Today, I build in the cloud - with code, with curiosity, and a habit of figuring things out as I go.**

**I’ve taught myself everything I know about software. Not in a classroom, but through late nights, open tabs, and projects that broke before they worked. I learned by trying things, breaking stuff, and refusing to wait for permission.**

**I care about clarity over noise. Real over fake. Thoughtful, small things over flashy, empty ones.**

**This site is where I share what I’m building - and the mindset behind it.**
