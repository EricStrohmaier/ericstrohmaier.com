# About Me

---

**Truth**: I find happiness when I'm working just beyond my comfort zone. Real satisfaction comes from problems that push me.

**Flow**: When I'm coding, time disappears. I think twenty minutes passed, but it's been three hours. That's when I know I'm learning.

**Minimalist approach: keeping my mind clear and my setup clean - which allows me to dive deep into projects without distractions.**
